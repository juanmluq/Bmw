<summary>Enabling Stripe Tax</summary>

   In the [`create-checkout-session.php`](./public/create-checkout-session.php) file you will find the following code commented out
   ```php
   // 'automatic_tax' => ['enabled' => true],
   ```

   Uncomment this line of code and the sales tax will be automatically calculated during the checkout.

   Make sure you previously went through the set up of Stripe Tax: [Set up Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up) and you have your products and prices updated with tax behavior and optionally tax codes: [Docs - Update your Products and Prices](https://stripe.com/docs/tax/checkout#product-and-price-setup)
